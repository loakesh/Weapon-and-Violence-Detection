# Weapon-and-Violence-Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a high-accuracy system for detecting violence and weapons in video footage. The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to analyze each frame of a video stream and make real-time predictions. The objective of this research project is to enhance safety and security by detecting potential threats in public spaces.
